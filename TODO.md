# Stages
- move player
- create ball
- make player collision with ball
    - highlight when ball in grab zone
    - add "impact" zone if comes into contact with player
- allow player to hold the ball
- make "reflector" enemy that throws the ball directly back
-

# Idea
- per game, players are given a random set of hats to pick from (and have to run to get them)
